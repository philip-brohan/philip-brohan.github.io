Philip Brohan's stuff
=====================

I am old enough to have a homepage as a central web presence, but this page is rarely updated; for real-time action, see my pages at `Twitter <https://twitter.com/PhilipBrohan>`_, `GitHub <https://github.com/philip-brohan>`_, or `Vimeo <https://vimeo.com/philipbrohan>`_.

Software
--------

- Tools for weather model and reanalysis data:
    - `IRData: Accessing synoptic-timescale Reanalysis Data with Iris <http://brohan.org/IRData/>`_
    - `Meteorographica: python code for plotting weathermaps <https://brohan.org/Meteorographica/>`_
- `Tools for International Maritime Meteorological Archive records  <https://github.com/oldweather/IMMA>`_

Datasets

Collaborations

Under Construction
------------------

- `20CR version 3 <https://oldweather.github.io/20CRv3-diagnostics/>`_

I have given up writing research papers (I make datasets, software, and videos instead), but many of those I have written are listed by `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dJZ6zekAAAAJ&hl=en>`_
